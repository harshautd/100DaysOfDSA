# Why \(3n^2 + 2n + 2\) and \(n^2\) are both Big-O and Big-\(\Omega\) but not \(n\) and \(n \log n\)

To understand why \(3n^2 + 2n + 2\) and \(n^2\) are both Big-O and Big-\(\Omega\) of each other, but \(n\) and \(n \log n\) are not, we need to delve into the definitions of Big-O and Big-\(\Omega\) and analyze the growth rates of these functions.

## Definitions

1. **Big-O Notation (\(O\))**:
   - A function \(f(n)\) is said to be \(O(g(n))\) if there exist positive constants \(c\) and \(n_0\) such that \(0 \leq f(n) \leq c \cdot g(n)\) for all \(n \geq n_0\). This means \(g(n)\) is an upper bound on \(f(n)\).

2. **Big-\(\Omega\) Notation (\(\Omega\))**:
   - A function \(f(n)\) is said to be \(\Omega(g(n))\) if there exist positive constants \(c\) and \(n_0\) such that \(0 \leq c \cdot g(n) \leq f(n)\) for all \(n \geq n_0\). This means \(g(n)\) is a lower bound on \(f(n)\).

## Analysis of \(3n^2 + 2n + 2\) and \(n^2\)

### Big-O Relationship
- We need to show that \(3n^2 + 2n + 2\) is \(O(n^2)\).
- For large \(n\), the term \(3n^2\) dominates \(2n\) and \(2\).
- We can choose \(c = 4\) and \(n_0 = 1\). Then, \(3n^2 + 2n + 2 \leq 4n^2\) for all \(n \geq 1\).
- Therefore, \(3n^2 + 2n + 2\) is \(O(n^2)\).

### Big-\(\Omega\) Relationship
- We need to show that \(3n^2 + 2n + 2\) is \(\Omega(n^2)\).
- For large \(n\), \(3n^2\) is the dominant term.
- We can choose \(c = 1\) and \(n_0 = 1\). Then, \(3n^2 + 2n + 2 \geq n^2\) for all \(n \geq 1\).
- Therefore, \(3n^2 + 2n + 2\) is \(\Omega(n^2)\).

Since \(3n^2 + 2n + 2\) is both \(O(n^2)\) and \(\Omega(n^2)\), they are asymptotically equivalent in terms of growth rate.

## Analysis of \(n\) and \(n \log n\)

### Big-O Relationship
- We need to determine if \(n\) is \(O(n \log n)\).
- For large \(n\), \(n \log n\) grows faster than \(n\).
- We can choose \(c = 1\) and \(n_0 = 2\). Then, \(n \leq n \log n\) for all \(n \geq 2\).
- Therefore, \(n\) is \(O(n \log n)\).

### Big-\(\Omega\) Relationship
- We need to determine if \(n\) is \(\Omega(n \log n)\).
- For large \(n\), \(n \log n\) grows faster than \(n\), so \(n\) cannot be a lower bound for \(n \log n\).
- There is no constant \(c\) such that \(n \geq c \cdot n \log n\) for all \(n \geq n_0\).
- Therefore, \(n\) is not \(\Omega(n \log n)\).

Since \(n\) is \(O(n \log n)\) but not \(\Omega(n \log n)\), they are not asymptotically equivalent in terms of growth rate.

## Conclusion

- \(3n^2 + 2n + 2\) and \(n^2\) are both Big-O and Big-\(\Omega\) of each other because they have the same dominant term \(n^2\), making their growth rates equivalent.
- \(n\) and \(n \log n\) are not both Big-O and Big-\(\Omega\) of each other because \(n \log n\) grows faster than \(n\), making their growth rates different.

This analysis highlights the importance of the dominant term in determining the asymptotic behavior of functions.
