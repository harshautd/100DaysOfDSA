# Why 3n² + 2n + 2 and n² are both Big-O and Big-Ω but not n and n log n

To understand why 3n² + 2n + 2 and n² are both Big-O and Big-Ω of each other, but n and n log n are not, we need to delve into the definitions of Big-O and Big-Ω and analyze the growth rates of these functions.

## Definitions

1. **Big-O Notation (O)**:
   - A function f(n) is said to be O(g(n)) if there exist positive constants c and n₀ such that 0 ≤ f(n) ≤ c · g(n) for all n ≥ n₀. This means g(n) is an upper bound on f(n).

2. **Big-Ω Notation (Ω)**:
   - A function f(n) is said to be Ω(g(n)) if there exist positive constants c and n₀ such that 0 ≤ c · g(n) ≤ f(n) for all n ≥ n₀. This means g(n) is a lower bound on f(n).

## Analysis of 3n² + 2n + 2 and n²

### Big-O Relationship
- We need to show that 3n² + 2n + 2 is O(n²).
- For large n, the term 3n² dominates 2n and 2.
- We can choose c = 4 and n₀ = 1. Then, 3n² + 2n + 2 ≤ 4n² for all n ≥ 1.
- Therefore, 3n² + 2n + 2 is O(n²).

### Big-Ω Relationship
- We need to show that 3n² + 2n + 2 is Ω(n²).
- For large n, 3n² is the dominant term.
- We can choose c = 1 and n₀ = 1. Then, 3n² + 2n + 2 ≥ n² for all n ≥ 1.
- Therefore, 3n² + 2n + 2 is Ω(n²).

Since 3n² + 2n + 2 is both O(n²) and Ω(n²), they are asymptotically equivalent in terms of growth rate.

## Analysis of n and n log n

### Big-O Relationship
- We need to determine if n is O(n log n).
- For large n, n log n grows faster than n.
- We can choose c = 1 and n₀ = 2. Then, n ≤ n log n for all n ≥ 2.
- Therefore, n is O(n log n).

### Big-Ω Relationship
- We need to determine if n is Ω(n log n).
- For large n, n log n grows faster than n, so n cannot be a lower bound for n log n.
- There is no constant c such that n ≥ c · n log n for all n ≥ n₀.
- Therefore, n is not Ω(n log n).

Since n is O(n log n) but not Ω(n log n), they are not asymptotically equivalent in terms of growth rate.

## Conclusion

- 3n² + 2n + 2 and n² are both Big-O and Big-Ω of each other because they have the same dominant term n², making their growth rates equivalent.
- n and n log n are not both Big-O and Big-Ω of each other because n log n grows faster than n, making their growth rates different.

This analysis highlights the importance of the dominant term in determining the asymptotic behavior of functions.
