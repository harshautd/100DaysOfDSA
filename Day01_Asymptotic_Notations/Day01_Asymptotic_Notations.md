An **algorithm** is a step-by-step procedure or set of rules to solve a problem or perform a task. It is a well-defined sequence of instructions that take an input, process it, and produce an output.

**Key Characteristics of an Algorithm:**
Finiteness: An algorithm must always terminate after a finite number of steps. It should not run indefinitely.
Definiteness: Each step of the algorithm should be precisely defined, leaving no ambiguity.
Input & Output: Algo takes input and produces an output.
Effective: An algo should solve the problem for all possible I/Ps with in a reasonable amount of time.

**Time Complexity** and **Space Complexity** are key concepts in analyzing the efficiency of algorithms. These two complexities describe how the resource usage (time or memory) of an algorithm grows as the size of the input increases.

**Asymptotic Analysis** is the study of the performance (time or space complexity) of algorithms as the input size grows towards infinity. It helps in understanding how the algorithm behaves for large inputs and comparing different algorithms' efficiency.

**Why Asymptotic Analysis?**
It is important because:

It helps to predict how an algorithm will scale as the input size increases.
It provides a way to compare the efficiency of different algorithms without worrying about constant factors or small input sizes.
